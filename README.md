# NLP Personal Assistant

## Overview
The goal is to create a personal assistant similar to Siri or Alexa (simplified version).
The code is able to record the audio through the microphone Speech-to-Text STT, then understant what the user said and run the suitable command. The command will run, then using the Text-to-Speech TTS will the program communicate with the user about the action.
The program has a simple GUI interface, where the user can see the conversation between him and the assistant as text.

The perosnal assistant could handle a couple of tasks:

- Search in Wikipedia
- Open Youtubte
- Open Google
- Open Gmail
- Check the current time
- Open news website
- Take a picture of the user
- Search in browser
- Replay about its mood
- Give info about itself and some available commands
- Tell funny jokes
- Shutdown the personal assistant when the user says so
